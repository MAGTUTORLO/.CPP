An <cite>anagram</cite> of a word or phrase is the result of
rearranging its letters to form another meaningful word or
phrase.  For example, the an anagram of "anagram&nbsp;finder"
is "garden&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;farm" (work it out!).

<p>

<a href="/">Fourmilab</a>'s interactive anagram finder
lets you explore acronyms for any phrase you wish.  Unlike
many other such resources on the Internet, our anagram finder
is organised to help you find interesting and/or funny acronyms
without searching through a vast lists composed mostly of
obscure words you've never heard of.

<p>

Acronyms are generated
in a four step process.  First, you enter the word or phrase
for which you're seeking the acronyms.  This produces a list
of words contained in acronyms of your word or phrase.
Many of these words will be obscure or uninteresting, so
at this stage you can filter them for further exploration.
Selecting one of the words and submitting it proceeds to
step 3, which shows you all the anagrams containing that
word (there may, of course, only be one).  You can then
choose one of the anagrams and generate all of its
<em>permutations</em> (all possible results of reordering
words in the phrase).  Phrases from the permuted results may
then be copied and pasted into other documents.

<p>

Each step in the anagram generation process recapitulates (without recomputing)
the earlier steps, so you can back up to any earlier step at
any point in the process.  The anagram finder is an application
which runs on the <a href="/">Fourmilab</a> server, so
you don't need a fast computer or lots of memory to use it.

<p>

Anagrams are generated based on the official dictionary (second
edition) of that 
<a href="http://www.scrabble.com/" target="_blank">crossword game</a>
whose name you cannot mention
without having lawyers burst out of your screen brandishing
menacing documents, courtesy of Grady Ward's
<a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/research/ilash/Moby/" target="_blank">Moby Words</a>
compilation.  We search the dictionary in decreasing order of word
length, as longer words tend to produce more interesting anagrams.
Only alphabetic characters are considered in anagrams, and accented
characters are "flattened" by removing the accents.

<h2>Step 1</h2>

Type the phrase for which you seek anagrams into the box below and
press the "Submit" button to generate a list of words which
appear in anagrams of this phrase.
