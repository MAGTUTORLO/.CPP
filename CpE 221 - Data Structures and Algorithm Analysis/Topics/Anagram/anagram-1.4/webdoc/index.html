An <cite>anagram</cite> of a word or phrase is the result of
rearranging its letters to form another meaningful word or
phrase.  For example, an anagram of "anagram&nbsp;finder"
is "garden&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;farm" (work it out!).

<p>

This page describes, in Unix manual page style, a C++ program
<a href="#download">available for downloading</a> from this site
which finds English language anagrams for a phrase.  The program
is available as source code compatible with any current C++
compiler or as a ready-to-run 32-bit Windows executable.

<p>

Anagrams are generated based on the official dictionary (second
edition) of that 
<a href="http://www.scrabble.com/" target="_blank">crossword game</a>
whose name you cannot mention
without having lawyers burst out of your screen brandishing
menacing documents, courtesy of Grady Ward's
<a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/research/ilash/Moby/" target="_blank">Moby Words</a>
compilation.  We search the dictionary in decreasing order of word
length, as longer words tend to produce more interesting anagrams.
Only alphabetic characters are considered in anagrams, and accented
characters are "flattened" by removing the accents.

<p>

Users may create their own dictionaries from word lists; this
permits supporting other languages and vocabularies, for example,
using only words which appeared in the works of Shakespeare.  If
you create interesting dictionaries and wish to share them, please
get in touch--we'll be glad to host them on this site.

<h3>NAME</h3>

<blockquote>
     <b>anagram</b> - find anagrams for phrase
</blockquote>

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<blockquote>
     <tt>anagram</tt> [ <em>options</em> ] [ <tt>'</tt><em>target phrase</em><tt>'</tt> [ <em>seed</em>... ] ]
</blockquote>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<b>anagram</b>
finds anagrams or permutations of words in the <em>target phrase</em>.
If one or more
<em>seed</em> words is given, only anagrams containing all of those words
will be shown.  The target and seed may be specified by options or
CGI program environment variables as well as on the command line.

<h3>OPTIONS</h3>
Options are specified on the command line prior to the input and
output file names (if any).  Options may appear in any order.  Long
options beginning with "<tt>--</tt>" may be abbreviated to any
unambiguous prefix; single-letter options introduced by a single "<tt>-</tt>"
may be aggregated.

<dl>

<p>
<dt> <b>--all</b> <dd>Generate all anagrams in <tt>--cgi&nbsp;--step&nbsp;2</tt>.

<p>
<dt> <b>--bail</b> <dd>Bail out after the first anagram found containing a word.
    In many cases this drastically reduces the time required
    to run the program.  You can review the list of words
    appearing in anagrams and then request a complete list
    of anagrams containing "interesting" ones.

<p>
<dt> <b>--bindict</b>, <b>-b</b> <em>file</em> <dd>Load binary dictionary from <em>file</em>.
    The default binary dictionary is <tt>wordlist.bin</tt>.

<p>
<dt> <b>--cgi</b> <dd>When executed as a CGI program on a Web server, set
    options from form fields.  These
    settings may be overridden by command line options which
    follow <tt>--cgi</tt>.

<p>
<dt> <b>--copyright</b> <dd>Print copying information.

<p>
<dt> <b>--dictionary</b>, <b>-d</b> <em>file</em> <dd>Load word list from <em>file</em>.
    This is (only) used with the <tt>--export</tt> option to compile a
    word list into a binary dictionary.  The default word list
    is <tt>crossword.txt</tt>.
    
<p>
<dt> <b>--export</b> <em>file</em> <dd>Create a binary dictionary <em>file</em> from the
    word list specified by the <tt>--dictionary</tt> option or the default
    <tt>crossword.txt</tt>.
    
<p>
<dt> <b>--help</b>, <b>-u</b> <dd>Print how-to-call information including a
list of options.

<p>
<dt> <b>--html</b>, <b>-h</b> <dd>Generate HTML output when run as a CGI program on a Web
    server.  The HTML is based on the template file specified by
    the <tt>--template</tt> option, which defaults to a file named
    <tt>template.html</tt> in the current directory.
    
<p>
<dt> <b>--permute</b>, <b>-p</b> <b>'</b><em>phrase</em><b>'</b><dd>Print all permutations of words in the
    given <em>phrase</em>.  The phrase must be quoted so that blanks
    separating words are considered part of the single <em>phrase</em>
    argument.
    
<p>
<dt> <b>--seed</b>, <b>-s</b> <em>word</em><dd>Find only anagrams which contain the
    specified <em>word</em>.  You may specify as many seed words as
    you wish (each with a separate <tt>--seed</tt> option) to restrict the
    anagrams to those containing all of the seed words.  To
    obtain a list of words which appear in anagrams of a phrase,
    specify the <tt>--bail</tt> option.  You can also specify seed words
    on the command line after the options and target phrase, if any.

<p>
<dt> <b>--step</b> <em>number</em><dd>Perform step <em>number</em> when operating as a
    CGI program on a Web server.  Step 0, the default, selects non-CGI
    operation; the program acts as a command line utility.  In step 1,
    a list of words appearing in anagrams is generated.  Step 2 generates
    anagrams in which a selected word appears (or, all anagrams
    if the HTML template permits this option).  Step 3 generates all
    permutations of words in a selected anagram.

<p>
<dt> <b>--target</b>, <b>-t</b> <b>'</b><em>phrase</em><b>'</b><dd>Generate anagrams or permutations for
    the specified <em>phrase</em>, which must be quoted if it contains more than
    a single word.  If no <tt>--target</tt> is specified, the program uses the first
    command line argument as the target.

<p>
<dt> <b>--verbose</b>, <b>-v</b> <dd>Print diagnostic information as the program
    performs various operations.
    
<p>
<dt> <b>--version</b> <dd>Print program version information.

</dl>

<h3>FILES</h3>

Output is written to standard output and may be redirected or piped
to another program in the usual manner.  When generating HTML as a CGI
program, it is the responsibility of the shell script which invokes
<b>anagram</b> to emit the <tt>Content-type:&nbsp;text/html</tt>
and blank line which precedes the HTML.  This permits changing the
type to <tt>text/plain</tt> for debugging.

<h3>BUGS</h3>

The standard dictionary includes many extremely obscure words, including
all the curious short words permitted in That Crossword Game.  Consequently,
anagrams of phrases with many high-frequency letters will often include
these words.  Sorting through them all can be tedious and (see below) time
consuming.  Somebody ought to edit the dictionary and create an
"interesting word" list which excludes the esoterica.

<p>

Long phrases containing many high-frequency letters may have tens or
hundreds of millions of anagrams, not counting permutations.  If you
launch such a search, be aware of the potential consequences.  If you're
setting up the program on a server, you may want to limit the resources
it can consume.
